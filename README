This provides comparative benchmarks of Roda, Rails, and Sinatra at
10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 routes.

To use:

  rake bench graphs

Note that rake bench can take quite a long time, especially on slower hardware.

The graphs task requires gruff to create the graphs.  You can skip this step if
you want, and just look at the underlying .csv files produced by the bench
task.
