This provides comparative benchmarks of Roda, Cuba, Rails, Sinatra, NYNY, and
Synfeld with 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 routes. It also benchmarks Roda with
the multi_route plugin and multiple Roda apps using run to dispatch, and
benchmarks a simple static route implementation as a baseline for performance.

To use:

  rake bench graphs

Note that rake bench can take quite a long time, especially on slower hardware.

If you only want to benchmark specific apps, set the R10K_APPS environment
variable:

  rake bench graphs R10K_APPS="roda cuba"

The builders directory contains the files that build the applications.
If you want to examine the application files used for benchmarking, you can
use the build task and then look in the apps directory.  The bench task
produces CSV files which are stored in the data directory.  The graphs
task takes those CSV files and turns them into nice looking graphs (using
gruff).
